      "question": "Raman is confident of speaking English _______ six months as he has been practising regularly _______ the last three weeks.",
      "a": "during, for",
      "b": "for, since",
      "c": "for, in",
      "d": "within, for",
      "ans": "d",
      "Explanation": "'Within' means ‘inside or not further than a particular area or space’. We can use within to refer to time. In ‘present perfect continuous tense’ to talk about a period of time: We use 'since' to refer back to a previous point in time. We use 'since' as a preposition with a date, a time or a noun phrase. We use 'for' with a period of time to refer to duration (how long something lasts). After a negative we can use 'for' and 'in' with the same meaning. In is particularly common in American. We use 'in' to say how long it takes someone to do something. We use 'during' before nouns and noun phrases to refer to when something happens over a period of time. During can refer to the whole time of the event. We don’t use 'during' when we refer to numbers and lengths of time. In this case, we use 'for'. Option (D) is correct."
